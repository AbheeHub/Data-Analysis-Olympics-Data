### Olympics dataset analysis
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle.com<br>

### How will this analysis go?
<hr>
1. There is a lot of data for a lot of atheletes over many years.<br>
2. So to filter out this dataset and clean it, we will only choose players in the dataset who have won atleast any medal(GOLD/SILVER/BRONZE).<br>
3. This will automatically narrow the dataset.<br>
4. After that from that new data(DATA WITH PLAYERS HAVING MEDALS ONLY), we have to check whether there is any kind of null values or not. If not then ok but if there are null values then appropriate steps will be performed.<br>
5. After the data gets cleaned completely, we can perform the analysis steps on that data - like EDA, Visualizations, etc.<br>
6. We can perform analysis over particular COUNTRY we are interested in.<br>
7. Later we can do predictive analysis/prediction for medals for particular countries we are interested in.

<i>This approach is what looks good to me. Any developer/contributer can share his/her thoughts for the analysis of Olympics Data.</i>
